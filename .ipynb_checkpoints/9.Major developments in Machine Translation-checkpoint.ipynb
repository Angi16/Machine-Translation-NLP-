    "\n",
    "*    What is currently possible with today’s machine translation technology?\n",
    "*    What kinds of translation applications can be used in many contexts, and which applications are industry specific (in law, finance, and more)?\n",
    "*    Based on progress thus far, what seem to be the most promising use-cases for machine translation in business today?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before exploring B2B and consumer translation technology, let us have a brief look at the the insights summing up the machine translation applications and their use cases.\n",
    "# Machine Learning for Language Translation Applications – Insights Up Front\n",
    "\n",
    "From our research, the machine translation applications seem to fall into two major categories, depending on the target audience they serve.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Machine Translation in Industry for Business Use\n",
    "\n",
    "Although big players like Google Translate and Microsoft Translator offer near-accurate, real-time translations, some “domains” or industries call for highly-specific training data related to the particular domain in order to improve accuracy and relevancy. Here, generic translators would not be of much help as their machine-learning models are trained on generic data.\n",
    "\n",
    "These applications are used by small, medium and large enterprises. Some organizations offer multi-domain translation services–that is, customizable solutions across multiple domains–and other organizations offer translation solutions only for a specific domain. These solutions, although automated for the most part, still depend on human translators for pre- and post-editing processes. Some fields that warrant domain-specific machine translation solutions are:\n",
    "\n",
    "*    Government\n",
    "*    Software & technology\n",
    "*    Military & defence\n",
    "*    Healthcare\n",
    "*    Finance\n",
    "*    Legal\n",
    "*    E-discovery\n",
    "*    Ecommerce\n",
    "\n",
    "### Online / App Machine Translation for Consumer Use\n",
    "\n",
    "These machine learning applications perform instant translation for textual, audio, and image files (images of words on screens, papers, signboards, etc.) from a source language into a target language. These are typically generic–that is, non-domain specific–albeit with a high translation accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "These applications are usually light-weight, cloud-based apps or wearable devices that are typically trained on crowd-sourced data. These are mostly used by individual consumers, such as travelers, students, etc. Real-time translation applications most commonly offer:\n",
    "\n",
    "*    Text-to-text\n",
    "*    Text-to-speech\n",
    "*    Speech-to-text\n",
    "*    Speech-to-speech\n",
    "*    Image (of words)-to-text\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us first delve into how machine translation is employed across global businesses, followed by its consumer applications.\n",
    "# B2B Domain-Specific (Industry-Specific) Machine Translation\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the years, multiple organizations have cropped up with intelligent services and products offering domain-specific machine translation. General translators, that are usually used in consumer applications, such as Google Translate, may have difficulty translating data related to specific business domains, which have their own nuances and terminologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "These business domains are vast and include industries like technology, software, automotive, e-discovery, legal, financial, military & defence, healthcare, e-learning, ecommerce institutions, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "A machine translation system can be adapted to a specific domain by using training data from the same domain. For example, in order to adapt an MT system for the legal domain, training data including the most commonly used contextual terms, keywords, phrases, terminology, etc., in the legal domain are compiled into corpora, which act as an exhaustive data repository for the MT system to refer to and train on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the system’s usage and the models the system is built on, over time, the machine-learning algorithms better adapt themselves to providing more accurate translation results by refining and adding to the domain-specific corpora. More often than not, MT models are used in conjunction with human translators for perfecting the corpora and for post editing processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some corporations offer machine translation services in multiple domains, whereas others offer specialized services in a singular domain.\n",

    "\n",
    "Among the B2C machine translation applications, it is common knowledge that Google Translate is the biggest player. Its real-time translation capabilities now include text, speech, and image (of words), all packaged into a single platform in the form of a mobile app and cloud service.\n",
    "\n",
    "Google first announced the launch of Google Translate over a decade ago. Since then, it has consistently advanced to include speech recognition and image recognition technologies for translation. Most recently, the company launched the Google Neural Machine Translation system (GNMT).\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the research document linked above, GNMT uses the neural machine translation technology, which considers the entire input sentence as a single unit for translation, as opposed to breaking the sentence into words and phrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The below GIF model depicts how the GNMT works in translating Chinese to English. The research document reads, “First, the network encodes the Chinese words as a list of vectors, where each vector represents the meaning of all words read so far (“Encoder”).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the entire sentence is read, the decoder begins, generating the English sentence one word at a time (“Decoder”). You can find more information on how the technology works in the detailed research published by Google here.\n",

    "\n",
    "Facebook has been experimenting with machine translation for close to a decade. It launched the Translations app back in 2008, which used basic machine learning methods and crowd-sourced translations from its users to study and implement machine translation for its entire website. The Translations app has now evolved into a more sophisticated and intelligent Facebook Translate app that employs NMT.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2011, Facebook first introduced a new inline translation tool for its comments section, powered by Bing. The original announcement from Facebook about launching this tool using Bing seems to have been removed by Facebook. However, there are several third-party media sites, including [Mashable]('https://mashable.com/2011/10/06/facebook-translation-tool/#cqcfQkuF8Eqa'), which picked up on this news back in 2011, citing the same. You can find additional third-party sources [here]('https://www.adweek.com/digital/bing-translate-pages/'), [here]('https://www.searchenginejournal.com/facebook-translation-bing-translator/34629/'), and [here]('https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/23/facebook-translation/').\n",
    "\n",
    "From these sources, we gather that Facebook was working with Bing to expand its translation capabilities to comments on its news feed for over six years and 44 languages, until it launched its own AI-powered translation system in May 2016.\n",

    "\n",
    "In December 2014, Skype officially introduced a voice translation feature in their software that initially used a combination of speech recognition and statistical machine translation to instantly translate conversational speech in real-time between English and Spanish. The company claims that the training data for speech recognition and machine translation comes from a variety of sources, such as translated web pages, videos with captions, previously translated and transcribed one-on-one conversations, including data donated by organisations.\n",
    "\n",
    "As of 2017, Skype uses the Microsoft Translate technology, which runs on neural networks, to more accurately translate audio conversations in 18 languages and textual conversations in 60+ languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The speech-to-speech translation is achieved in four steps. First, using Automated Speech Recognition,  the system converts the source audio to raw text in the language it is spoken in. Then, it normalizes the text for conversational speech to make it more appropriate for translation. After normalization, the system then translates the source-language text to the intended target language using a text translation engine built on translation models specially developed for real-life spoken conversations. Finally, the system performs a text-to-speech translation to produce the translated audio.\n",
    "## Microsoft - How does speech translation work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Microsoft’s visualization of machine translation in action – source\n",
    "\n",
    "Microsoft has launched several independent projects to showcase the potential of Skype Translate across the globe. The video below demonstrates one such project where an aurally challenged American child who uses hearing aids and cochlear implants explores Skype Translate to converse with children speaking in Mandarin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although these independent project videos seemingly show a successful demonstration of Skype’s speech-to-speech translation in real-time, it still remains to be seen whether Skype Translate could become scalable enough to use widely in online classrooms and business conversations between organizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest drawback here, in order to improve the accuracy of speech-to-speech translation and to monitor the unique nuances of languages, Skype automatically records voice calls (after issuing an appropriate warning to the user) while the translate feature is being used. This poses a great security threat to organizations.\n",

    "The ili is a small, handheld voice translator, built to translate simple, common phrases for travelers. Although it is marketed as a wearable, this Tokyo-based technology uses only a simple chain for a traveler to wear around their neck with the device as the pendant. It works offline and does not require the Internet to instantly translate speech.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is currently only available in four languages (including English, Spanish, Mandarin, and Japanese) and does not support a two-way conversation. The ili’s website defends its preference of one-way translation by pointing out that travelers and tourists typically ask simple phrases that warrant yes or no answers. The ili has a built-in phrase-based translation engine, which can be updated by plugging the device into a USB port and connecting to the website.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ili initially launched a limited edition of only 3000 units, and according to its website, all 3000 units have been sold so far. Despite its seemingly several shortcomings, The ili has promised to sell more units in the near future.\n",

It is a product of a well-funded IndiGogo campaign that managed to raise above $ 4.5M$ from about 22,000 backers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The earbuds are paired with the Pilot app, which recognizes the speech, translates the source language to the target language using machine translation, and synthesizes the translated response. The website and the campaign page do not go into the details of the technology. They also make no false promises when it comes to translation accuracy. Instead, they claim that the accuracy gets better over time–as with most machine translation software.\n",

    "\n",
    "A defining success factor of machine translation applications is their accuracy level. With the advent of NMT, machine translation applications seem to be improving their accuracy level over time. They “learn” user behavior, language patterns, and nuances that are both language-specific and domain-specific, from the data they are trained on, which is a continuous process.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, they are still bound to make mistakes as machine translation is a fairly recent and still-evolving technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "While mistranslations could be a source of hilarity, in some situations it could bring about a life or death scenario. A recent NewsWeek article reports of an unfortunate incident in which an unassuming citizen of Israel was captured without warning, all because Facebook mistranslated his “Good Morning” in Arabic to “Attack them” in English. It did not help that he was leaning against a bulldozer. He was allegedly released after the police questioned him for several hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the news source, Necip Fazil Ayan, an engineering manager in Facebook’s language technologies group, provided the following statement:\n",

Even though our translations are getting better each day, mistakes like these might happen from time to time and we’ve taken steps to address this particular issue. We apologize to him and his family for the mistake and the disruption this caused.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Incidents such as this one also raises serious questions in the business context: How much would a mistranslation-related incident cost a business? How safe is it to use a third-party machine translation technology, especially in businesses requiring to translate confidential data? It remains to be seen how these challenges will be solved by technology in the near future. "
